The SPAMS toolbox for R is ditributed in source mode only.
It should compile on linux and Mac.
The installation procedure is described in the file \verb=INSTALL-package=
\begin{itemize}
\item Download the tar gzipped file, unpack it.
\item Set your environment variable R\_LIBS appropriately
\item Enter directory spams-R
\item execute \\
  \verb=R CMD INSTALL --html -l \$R\_LIBS spams=
\end{itemize}

You have the choice of the BLAS library, but the Intel 
MKL is recommended for the best performance.

If you want to add or change libraries, you must modify
the file \verb=spams/src/Makevars=.
