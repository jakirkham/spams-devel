tar zxf spams-R-xxxxxx.tgz
cd spams-R
# rlib=install-directory
export R_LIBS=$rlib
R CMD INSTALL --html -l $R_LIBS spams

This should work on linux and MacOS.
However, if you have undefined symbols like cblas_...,
you need to install libcblas (generally aprt of libatlas), and replace
in spams/Makevars the line
EXTRA_LIBS=
by something like
EXTRA_LIBS= -lcblas
In a future version of SPAMS the dependency upon libcbals will be removed.

# tests
Note : to run test_TrainDL and test_TrainDL_Memory you need the R package png
     (a version of this package can be found in the current directory).

export R_LIBS=$rlib
cd $rlib/spams/test
Rscript test_spams.R -help
Rscript test_spams.R

# Notes:
As the C++ interface is built by Swig, I must add
dummy documentations for 3 class S4 methods
(I could not avoid warnings in R CMD check).
If you have a version of R lower tah 2.13, there will remain
one warning with R CMD check, because SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS must be manually defined.
