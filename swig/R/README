This directory contains files to build the R interfaces
to the functions of spams library already interfaced with matlab.

This file describes how to build R interface from sources.

To install the SPAMS R package you can also just download the tar.gz archive
and follow instructions from INSTALL-package.

----------------------------------
Building from sources:
(you need SWIG and perl)

- ./mkdist
- cd dist/spams-R
- setup your R_LIBS environment variable
- R CMD INSTALL --html -l $R_LIBS spams

You will find in $R_LIBS/spams :
- doc/ : a copy of the pdf documentation of spams
- extdata/ : 2 images used by the tests of dictLearn toolbox 
- test/ : a bunch of test programs where you can find examples of usage
  of each function of the toolbox
- png_0.1-4.tar.gz : a version a the png R package, needed if you want to run
  tests for dictLearn toolbox of SPAMS

-------------------------
Running test programs :
- cd $R_LIBS/spams/test
- Rscript test_spams.R -h  : to get help
- Rscript test_spams.R  : will run all the tests
- Rscript test_spams.R linalg : test of linalg functions
- Rscript test_spams.R name1 name2 ... : run named tests
  .....

----------------------------------------
Using the interface :

spams functions are prefixed with spams.
They are only defined for data of type double.
They accept dense R vectors and "bycolumn" matrices, and sparse matrices of class dsCMatrix.

Examples :

--------
library("spams",lib.loc = "./lib")

X = matrix(rnorm(64 * 200),nrow = 64,ncol = 200,byrow = FALSE)
Y = matrix(rnorm(200 * 20000),nrow = 200,ncol = 20000,byrow = FALSE)
Z = spams.CalcXY(X,Y)

------
library("spams",lib.loc = "./lib")

m = 200;n = 200000; d= 0.05
# rSpMatrix is defined in test_spams.R to build a random csc matrix
A = rSpMatrix(m,n,floor(m * n * d))
AAt = spams.CalcAAt(A)

========================================

This part is for developpers only.

-------------------------
Interface building for test :
./mybuild
workdir : pkg/spams
input : spams.h, spams.i, spamstools.i, R_typemaps.i, r_spams.R, zzz.R
output : spams_1.0_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz  
       The script will also untar the package in ./lib

--------------------
Testing the interface :
export R_LIBS=`/bin/pwd`/lib
Rscript test_spams.R
